# lineplz
This is a single header library in C++ to draw lines to a PNG file.

Sometimes you just want simple debug output from simple things. 

Not intended for any other usecase. This is not intended for production output (an actual drawing library is then better such as Cairo or Skia).

## Instructions

Include the file "lineplz.h". Draw lines.

The viewport to lines is automatically scaled so it exports all the lines written.
